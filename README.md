# gpt_translate: Translating MD files with GPT-4

This is a tool to translate Markdown files without breaking the structure of the document. It is powered by OpenAI models and has multiple parsing and formatting options. The provided default example is the one we use to translate our documentation website [docs.wandb.ai](https://docs.wandb.ai) to [japanese](https://docs.wandb.ai/ja/) and [korean](https://docs.wandb.ai/ko/).

## Installation
We have a stable version on PyPI, so you can install it with pip:
```bash
$ pip install gpt-translate
```
or to get latest version from the repo:

```bash
$ cd gpt_translate
$ pip install .
```

Export your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=aa-proj-bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
```

## Usage

The library provides a set of commands that you can access as CLI. All the commands start by `gpt_translate.`:

- `gpt_translate.file`: Translate a single file
- `gpt_translate.folder`: Translate a folder recursively
- `gpt_translate.files`: Translate a list of files, accepts `.txt` list of files as input.
- `gpt_translate.eval`: Evaluate the quality of the translation

### Litellm Integration

This project now uses **litellm** as the default interface for interacting with language models.
Instead of calling the OpenAI API directly, all LLM interactions are performed using `litellm.acompletion`.
Key features include:
- **Asynchronous LLM Calls**: Efficient asynchronous completions via `litellm.acompletion`.
- **Pydantic Response Validation**: Responses are automatically validated with Pydantic models using `model_validate_json`, ensuring that outputs conform to expected schemas.
- **Enhanced Recursive Handling**: The `longer_create` function recursively handles token-limit scenarios by chaining completions.

These improvements simplify the translation pipeline while ensuring robust response validation and improved handling of long outputs.

We use GPT4 by default. You can change this on `configs/config.yaml`. The dafault values are:

```yaml
# Logs:
debug: false  # Debug mode
weave_project: "gpt-translate"  # Weave project
silence_openai: true  # Silence OpenAI logger

# Translation:
language: "ja"  # Language to translate to
config_folder: "./configs"  # Config folder, where the prompts and dictionaries are
replace: true  # Replace existing file
remove_comments: true  # Remove comments
do_translate_header_description: true  # Translate the header description
max_concurrent_calls: 7  # Max number of concurrent calls to OpenAI

# Files:
input_file: "docs/intro.md"  # File to translate
out_file: " intro_ja.md"  # File to save the translated file to
input_folder: null  # Folder to translate
out_folder: null  # Folder to save the translated files to
limit: null  # Limit number of files to translate

# Model:
model: "gpt-4o"
temperature: 1.0
max_tokens: 16000

```
You can override the arguments at runtime or by creating another `config.yaml` file. You can also use the `--config_path` flag to specify a different config file.

- The `--config_folder` argument is where the prompts and dictionaries are located, the actual `config.yaml` could be located somewhere else. Maybe I need a better naming here =P.

- You can add new languages by providing the language translation dictionaries in `configs/language_dicts`

## Examples

1. To translate a single file:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.file \
  --input_file README.md \
  --out_file README_es_.md \
  --language es
  --config_folder ./configs
```

2. Translate a list of files from `list.txt`:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.files \
  --input_file list.txt \
  --input_folder docs \ 
  --out_folder docs_ja \
  --language ja
  --config_folder ./configs
```

Note here that we need to pass and input and output folder. This is because we will be using the input folder to get the relative path and create the same folder structure in the output folder. This is tipically what you want for documentation websites that are organized in folders like `./docs`.

3. Translate a full folder recursively:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.folder \
  --input_folder docs \
  --out_folder docs_ja \
  --language ja
  --config_folder ./configs
```

If you don't know what to do, you can always do `--help` on any of the commands:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.* --help
```


## Weave Tracing

The library does a lot! keeping track of every piece of interaction is necessary. We added [W&B Weave](wandb.me/weave) support to trace every call to the model and underlying processing bits.

You can pass a project name to the CLI to trace the calls:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.folder \
  --input_folder docs \
  --output_folder docs_ja \
  --language ja \
  --weave_project gpt-translate
  --config_folder ./configs
```

## Evaluation

Once the translation is done, you can evaluate the quality of the translation by running:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.eval \
  --eval_dataset "Translation-ja:latest"
```

You can iterate on the translation prompts and dictionaries to improve the quality of the translation.

The config for the evaluation shares many similarities with the translation config, which is stored in `configs/eval_config.yaml`. The `configs/evaluation_prompt.txt` file contains the prompt used by the LLM Judge to evaluate the translation quality. Feel free to play with it to find better ways to evaluate the quality of the translation according to your needs.

> Whenever you run `gpt_translate.files` or `gpt_translate.folder`, it automatically creates a new Weave Dataset with the name in the format `Translation-{language}:{timestamp}`.

## Github Action

We supply an [action.yml file](action.yml) to use this library in a Github Action. It is not much tested, but it should work.

- You will need to setup your [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) API key as a secret in your Github repository as `WANDB_API_KEY`.

An example workflow is shown in https://github.com/tcapelle/dummy_docs and the [corresponding workflow file](https://github.com/tcapelle/dummy_docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)

## TroubleShooting

If you have any issue, you can always pass the `--debug` flag to get more information about what is happening:

```bash
$ gpt_translate.folder ... --debug
```
this will get you a very verbose output (calls to models, inputs and outputs, etc.)
